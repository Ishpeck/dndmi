# D&D 5e Monsters Index

A list of D&D monsters, clustered by challenge rating, with references to where you can find their stat blocks.  

Goal of this project is to have a simple, concise set of page references in markdown format. 

# TODO

 - Add stuff from Tales from the Yawning Portal.
 - Add stuff from Curse of Strahd
 - Add monsters clustered by their type (aberration, dragon, fiend, etc..)
